/** The delegate of a UIKPickerView object must adopt this protocol and implement at least some of
 its methods to provide the picker view with the data it needs to construct itself.

 The delegate implements the optional methods of this protocol to return height, width, row title, 
 and the view content for the rows in each component. It must also provide the content for each 
 componentâ€™s row, either as a string or a view. Typically the delegate implements other optional 
 methods to respond to new selections or deselections of component rows.
