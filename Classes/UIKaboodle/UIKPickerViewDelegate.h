// The delegate of a UIPickerView object must adopt this protocol and implement
// at least some of its methods to provide the picker view with the data it
// needs to construct itself.
//
// The delegate implements the optional methods of this protocol to return
// height, width, row title, and the view content for the rows in each
// component. It must also provide the content for each componentâ€™s row, either
// as a string or a view. Typically the delegate implements other optional
// methods to respond to new selections or deselections of component rows.
